How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    diff -u new_file old_file

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    We can maintain the versions and can fix the bugs

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Manual commit is required because it's always preferable for coding to maintain version accorind to 1 logic or funtinality while automatically saving is done at perticular time period, so using it we cann't maintain the version as per requirement

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Allowance for saving multiple files in one commit is faster ans saves the time when thw number of files are big.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log
    git diff old_version_id new_version_id

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    using version control if i can access old version so i can make chnages as a new version and also can access old version if needed

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

   Implement Git as a practical
